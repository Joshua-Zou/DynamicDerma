## Inspiration

Over one in four Americans suffer from skin disease, and it’s often hard to find out what skin disease you have. And using Google is very time consuming, because you’ll have to sift through all the search results that come up. That’s why we created DynamicDerma, a website that helps identify skin diseases, inform the user about them, and tell them where to get it cured.

  

## What it does

  

DynamicDerma is a user-friendly website with two main functions, the first being the **skincare evaluator**. All users have to do is upload an attachment of an image, and using machine learning, it will compare the image with the 20+ common skin diseases in our database. It will then inform users about what disease they have, its symptoms, when to see a doctor, how to treat it, and a few sample images. Next there’s the **dermatologist map**, which uses Google Maps to help users find the closest dermatologists so that they can get care quickly and reliably.

  

## How we built it

  

For the **front end** we used HTML/CSS to create the website and make it user friendly. For the **back end**, ADD MORE STUFF

  

## Challenges we ran into

  

- At one point our Google Images JavaScript library stopped working, but it eventually came on again. (If our skincare evaluator doesn't work at some point, the library probably had a temporary outage)

- ADD MORE STUFF

  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

  

 - We were able to work effectively while staying at our own houses to reduce the spread of Covid-19

- We managed to create a Node.js server that worked with our HTML/CSS/JavaScript website
